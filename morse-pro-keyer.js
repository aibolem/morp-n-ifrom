/*
    The Morse keyer tests for input on a timer, plays the apprpriate tone and passes the data to a decorer.
    Arguments:
        - keyCallback: a function which should return {0, 1, 2, 3} from the vitual "paddle" depending if nothing, a dit, a dah or both is detected
                            This implementation will play dits if both keys are detected.
        - messageCallback: a function which receives a dictionary with keys 'message', 'timings' and 'morse' for each decoded part (see MorseDecoder)
                            Its use here will result in a single character being returned each time.
        - audioContextClass: e.g. window.AudioContext
        - frequency: the frequency in Hz for the sidetone
        - wpm: speed of the keyer (defaults to 20)
